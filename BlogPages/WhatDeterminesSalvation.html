            <p>God commands all men everywhere to repent.</p>
            <br>

            <p>If I could save everyone I would, but it’s not in my power to save anyone. The only thing I can do for other’s salvation is to witness; to share the law and the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is on each individual to decide what they will do with the “calling” God has laid on them. “Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent BECAUSE He has set a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.” Acts 17:30-31</p>
            <br>

            <p>Each person has the law of God written on their hearts. “They [those who do not have the law] show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.” Romans 2:15</p>
            <br>

            <p>There is a dire importance to use the law, God’s 10 Commandments, when talking with the lost. The reason for this is that through the law we come to know that we are enemies of God. Paul said “I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, ‘You shall not covet.’”</p>
            <br>

            <p>The sorrow we feel after we have been convicted of our sin brings forth the need for repentance. God calls us to action. The action is to humble ourselves before God because we see that we have violated His law. (“Pride comes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.” Proverbs 16:18) We must fall on the mercy seat of Christ because our own goodness is not good enough to save us. One lie is all it takes to damn you to Hell (Rev. 21:8). 2 Cor. 7:10 “Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.”</p>
            <br>

            <p class="end_verses">“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” 1 John 1:9</p>
