            <h2>By Rachel Wood</h2>
            <p>October 3, 2025</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Can you say you love your enemies? We are commanded to love those who do not love us. If we do this, it says in Matthew 5, that we will be like our Father in heaven. We shall be perfect as He is perfect.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Do you know what this points to? That God the Father loves His enemies. In John 3 we see how much Jesus, God’s arm, loved His enemies. He died so that any who turn to believe in Him will be cleansed from their sins and saved on the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <br>

            <p>We will be judged on how well we love others (2 Corinthians 5 “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men...”). Let the love of Christ fill you and spur you on to forgive your enemies so that you can be a light pointing to Jesus who by the grace and mercy of God might save their souls. (Jeremiah 29:13 “And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.”)</p>
            <br>

            <p>They will know us by our love.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="end_verses">“ But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. ”<br>Matthew 5:44-48</p>
