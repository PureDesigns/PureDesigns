            <h2>By Rachel Wood</h2>
            <p>November 2024</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>The mustard seed stands for an analogy Jesus used to show His disciples that the amount of faith does not matter. What matters is who your faith is in. Each person has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). We are all worthy to partake of our just wage (“For the wages of sin is death…” and “We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what has been done, weather good or bad.” 2 Cor. 5:10). One lie is enough to condemn us before such a holy God, for “all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone.” Rev. 21:8</p>
            <br>

            <p>But because God does not wish that anyone should perish (1Peter 3:9), He sent His Son Jesus to make a way for salvation that all who believe in Him might not perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16-18).</p>
            <br>

            <p>For this reason, when we are convicted of our sin, we must cry out for forgiveness. “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.’ Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded. Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.” James 4:6-10</p>
            <br>

            <p>When Jesus began His ministry, He preached “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Matt 4:17. God “commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.” Acts 17:30-31</p>
            <br>

            <p>If you hear His voice today do not harden your heart. Humble yourselves before the Lord to repent of your sins and have faith in Jesus. And the peace of God will dwell in your heart because you are made into a new creation, created for righteousness and holiness. Those who have been redeemed are those who have been set free (2 Corinthians 3:17).</p>
            <br>

            <p>We now have a new task of telling others about not only the freedom in Christ, but also the wrath of God which resides on them currently because of their sin. Only the blood which Jesus shed can cleanse us (“Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men…” 2 Corinthians 5:11 and “For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died and rose on their behalf." 2 Corinthians 5:14-15)</p>
            <br>

            <p>So, when you see the mustard seed I pray you will see the gospel in its entirety. That a little bit of faith in Jesus can move mountains.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="end_verses">“For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.” Ephesians 2:8-9</p>
