            <h2>By Rachel Wood</h2>

            <p>“I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.” Gal. 5:16 “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.” Gal. 5:25</p>
            <br>

            <p>Remain in the Spirit to win the battle on sin. Your flesh is not through fighting when the Spirit of Christ seals you for salvation. You are in a constant battle of good VS evil which wars for you and your choices. To take away our free will is to throw our hands up to the fight against temptation that we struggle with. God is our strength, Yes! But we must actively give ourselves to His strength. He will help us overcome, but He will not force us to overcome. “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.” 1 Cor. 10:13</p>
            <br>

            <p>The things we give ourselves to in ‘free America’ are killing the church. The modern day church is concerned with the things of this world, they care little to be truly transformed by God, because we would be required to give up our enjoyment and comfort. Instead, we pack out these buildings called churches and listen to a teacher who gets a paycheck judged on how many people come to listen. Our modern day gospel has been watered down where either being baptized, saying a prayer, or having an experience pass for salvation. Have we gone so far hat we have become the anti-Christ?</p>
            <br>

            <p>We have made a god of god f going to church and ‘fellowship’ when that is not the kind of religion we were called to. “Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.” James 1:27</p>
            <br>

            <p>We are called to love with a pure heart and to know our God and Savior (Jn. 17:3). The things of this world; entertainment, evil desires, and anything which distracts against our focus on Jesus and the path He laid before us, should be pushed aside. Because our home is not here but in the place God will make for us on the new earth, where God dwells among men.</p>
