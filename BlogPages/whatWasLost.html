            <h2>By Rachel Wood</h2>

            <p>In the garden of Eden, when Adam and Eve sinned, our greatest loss was the relationship they had with God Almighty.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Because of sin, our holy God had to separate from us and, one day, judge humanity for their actions. “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Romans 6:23</p>
            <br>

            <p>If it had not been for the Messiah, coming in human form to be the sacrificial lamb, then we would never truly have that relationship back; nor would we be safe on Judgment Day.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Mercy and grace is waiting for all who turn toward God through His Son Jesus Christ. Being truly sorrowful for your sin and believing in Jesus as the Messiah is the entrance to the narrow road. Walking that road requires the fruit of repentance.<br><br>“God has not called us to be fruitful, He called us to be faithful.” - Living Waters Podcast</p>
            <br>

            <p>As we who believe walk in faithfulness, with our heads in the clouds as a hopeful expectation of seeing our Lord rightfully adorn, then the fruit that comes from the Spirit will flow from us.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="end_verses">“He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.”<br>John 7:38 NKJV</p>
