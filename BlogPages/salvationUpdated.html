            <h2>By Rachel Wood</h2>
            <p>October 16, 2025</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Titus 3:1-7</p>
            <br>

            <p>Salvation is all due to Jesus and the work He did on the cross.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“according to His mercy He saved us” “not by any righteous works which we have done” but “through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit”.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Jesus is the key and the door. All we must do is believe in Jesus for the saving of our souls and cleansing from our sins.</p>
            <br>

            <p>1) We must see our sin through the eyes of God who is so holy no sin can be found in His presence without it being consumed. <b>Romans 7:7-25</b><br><br>2) We must hear about Jesus and what He did for us on the cross to save us from God’s wrath being poured out on us because of our sin. <b>Romans 10:17, 2 Corinthians 15:35, Romans 5:6-11</b><br><br>3) We must believe on Jesus for salvation. <b>Acts 4:12, Romans 10:9-13</b></p>
            <br>

            <p>Then Jesus does the rest by pouring out His Holy Spirit on us to seal us for the Day of Judgment (or the Day of Adoption for Christians, Romans 8:22-23).</p>
            <br>

            <p>After that, we are a new creation, “created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.” Ephesians 2:10</p>
            <br>

            <p>Our goal as Christians is to love the Lord your God with all of your heart, mind, and soul, and to love your neighbor as you love yourself (with no partiality). If you are truly saved, and the Spirit of God dwells in you, then the more you seek the Lord, the more your love for Him will grow. And the more you love God, the more your relationship with Him will grow. And the more the relationship grows, the more the light of Christ shines from you to reach the lost.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="end_verses">“For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.”<br>2 Corinthians 5:14-15</p>
