            <br>
            <br>

            <p>So easily, the Christian can slip into an attitude of pride which hinders their walk with Christ, which in turn hinders their light from shining. Pride makes us think we are better than others. In short, pride is taking our eyes off of Christ to set them on our accomplishments, our favorite part of ourselves. This is what the world thinks is good. It’s what the world applauds. But Jesus said “But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise…” 1 Cor. 1:27</p>
            <br>

            <p>“Pride comes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.” Proverbs 16:18</p>
            <br>

            <p>It is so easy to slip from our secure positions (1 Cor. 10:12-13). We need to be continually aware and ready to fight the battle we are so clearly in. This battle will not be over until we are home with the Lord. As a Christian, we should see this and groan because it is so continual. And if we were previously focused on the physical things of this life we must now understand that we need to give them up to follow Christ (Luke 14:33). We should now understand what it means to hate your life.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“Whoever loves his life will lose it, but whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.” John 12:25</p>
            <br>

            <p>Now, dear Christian, you may understand a little more why it is so important to read your Bible, to spend time with God building your relationship with Him. Because when we are found weak in the Spirit, we are susceptible to the fiery arrows from the devil. We will be caught with our shields down and our sword unsharpened. (Eph. 6:10-20) So walk each day with your focus on the Lord and His kingdom. It will not be very long, and we will be found in His presence. This life is a vapor, make the most of every day the Lord gives you.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Once you are strong in your relationship with Christ He will open doors to witness to the lost. “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to Him, and He will make your path straight.” Prov. 3:5-6</p>
            <br>

            <p>Our attitude should be one of soberness, ready to compel the lost to enter through the narrow gate. To compel them to come to the truth of the gospel. If your believe there is only one truth, then you should not be ashamed of it. You should desire others to see the Truth, which is Christ, be humbled to the point of repentance (2 Cor. 7:8-10), and be forgiven by God. That should be our forward focus.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="end_verses">“And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man.” 1 Cor. 15:49</p>
            <br>

            <p class="end_verses">“Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.” 2 Cor. 4:16-18</p>
