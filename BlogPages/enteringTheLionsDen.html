            <h2>By Rachel Wood</h2>
            <p>March 24, 2023</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>As a modern-day American Christian, I struggle with the idea of suffering for my faith in Christ. Suffering doesn’t happen that often in “free” America. I say “free” because in the past few years (2020-2023) it seems like we are having less and less freedom when it comes to opinion, free speech, and the blatant right to life (concerning abortion). We are being pressured on so many sides, but actual suffering for our faith in Christ has not yet been established in the extreme cases (such as losing our jobs on a mass level).</p>
            <br>

            <p>There are people who we have heard, such as sports payers or cake bakers, who have been persecuted because of their stance for their Christian faith.</p>
            <br>

            <p>However, today I want to talk about entering into the lion den; standing up with Christ, proclaiming His name as truth in a world that is so taken with lies. The other day, I felt like I was headed into the lion’s den, but then I remembered God was with Daniel in the lion’s den. God kept him safe because Daniel was following God’s will. Daniel didn’t let man determine truth; instead, his biggest goal was staying faithful to God. Then I remembered Jesus went to the lions den. And He allowed them to touch Him, beat Him, and kill Him. He was following the will of His Father. The most important thing for us to remember is Who we’re trying to please, God or man (Gal. 1:10).</p>
            <br>

            <p>The things that set us apart from the world are the fleshly things God has called us away from. The music, TV, movies, books, drinking (Not that there is anything wrong with drinking alcohol, but the world values it so highly and it is such a slippery slope to becoming addicted or becoming drunk that it might be better to abstain, so you and others don’t fall [1 Cor. 10:23-11:1]. However, it is still a personal decision that you are free to make), witchcraft (such as mysticism, tarot cards, zodiac), sex outside of marriage, or standing with the LGBTQ community all are things that the world has no problem with. I’m being totally serious. When we desire God alone, the things of this world appear as filth to us because “God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all.” 1 John 1:5</p>
            <br>

            <p>“Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. I saw that from what appeared to be His waist up He looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down He looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded Him. Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around Him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.” Ezekiel 1:26-28</p>
            <br>

            <p>When we’re walking with God on a daily basis, eat, sleep, breath for Him, and following His will, we can have confidence that He is with us when we enter into the lion’s den.</p>
