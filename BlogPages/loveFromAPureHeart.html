            <p>Pride and selfishness gets in the way of true love. When pride is present, there is no love for others because you are distracted with how you look. When selfishness is present, love is cast away because the only person you are caring about is yourself.</p>
            <br>

            <p>True love throws looks and self out the door to focus on the needs of others. This is the love Jesus calls us to.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends the rain on the just and on the unjust.</p>
            <br>

            <p>For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not event the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.” Matthew 5:43-48</p>
